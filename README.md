Command and Behavioral Patterns Repository
Welcome to the Command and Behavioral Patterns Repository! This repository contains implementations of various behavioral design patterns in software engineering. Each project demonstrates a unique pattern, with a clear structure, detailed code, and usage examples. This repository is ideal for learning, understanding, and applying design patterns in real-world scenarios.

Overview
Each project in this repository implements a specific behavioral design pattern. Behavioral patterns define how objects communicate and interact with each other in a flexible and scalable way. Understanding these patterns is crucial for building maintainable and robust systems, as they provide solutions for managing complex interactions between classes and objects.

Projects
1. ChainOfResponsibilityApp
Pattern: Chain of Responsibility
Description: This project demonstrates the Chain of Responsibility pattern, which allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler in the chain can either process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern is beneficial when you have multiple handlers that can process a request and want to decouple the sender and receiver of the request.

Key Components:

ISupportHandler (Interface): Defines methods for handling a request and setting the next handler in the chain.
BasicSupportHandler, IntermediateSupportHandler, AdvancedSupportHandler (Concrete Classes): Each handler represents a level of support that processes a request if it matches its criteria. If unable to handle the request, it passes it to the next handler in the chain.
Program.cs: The main entry point where the chain of responsibility is set up, and different requests are tested.
Use Case: In a support system, this pattern is used to escalate support requests through different levels (basic, intermediate, advanced) based on the complexity of the issue. Each level of support has its own handler, and requests are passed up the chain until they find a handler capable of resolving them.

2. CommandPatternApp
Pattern: Command
Description: This project showcases the Command pattern, which encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and providing a mechanism for logging and undoable operations. The Command pattern decouples the classes that invoke operations from the classes that perform these operations.

Key Components:

ICommand (Interface): Defines the Execute and Undo methods for all command classes.
AccessResourceCommand, ModifyResourceCommand, UndoAccessResourceCommand, UndoModifyResourceCommand (Concrete Classes): Each command represents a specific action, such as accessing or modifying a resource. Each command is self-contained and capable of executing and undoing the action.
ResourceManager (Receiver): This class performs the actual operations, such as accessing or modifying resources. The commands interact with this class to perform their actions.
CommandInvoker: Manages command execution and undo operations. It keeps a history of executed commands in a stack, allowing commands to be undone in the reverse order of execution.
Program.cs: The main entry point where commands are created, executed, and managed by the invoker. Demonstrates command execution and undo functionality.
Use Case: In a resource management system, this pattern is useful for implementing actions that can be undone, such as granting access to a resource or modifying it. With the invoker and receiver setup, commands can be managed in a consistent and reversible manner, making the system more flexible and user-friendly.

3. ObserverPatternApp
Pattern: Observer
Description: This project demonstrates the Observer pattern, which defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a change in the state of one object (the subject) automatically notifies and updates all of its dependents (observers). This pattern is commonly used when changes to an object need to be broadcasted to a set of dependent objects without tightly coupling them.

Key Components:

IObserver (Interface): Defines the Update method that will be called to notify observers of changes in the subject.
ISubject (Interface): Defines methods to add, remove, and notify observers.
AnnouncementChannel (Concrete Subject): Implements ISubject and keeps track of a list of observers. When an announcement is published, all registered observers are notified.
StudentObserver (Concrete Observer): Implements IObserver and reacts to updates from AnnouncementChannel.
Program.cs: The main entry point where the AnnouncementChannel subject is created, observers are registered, and announcements are published, demonstrating how observers are notified.
Use Case: In a notification system, the Observer pattern can be used to broadcast announcements to multiple subscribers. For instance, in an educational platform, students (observers) can subscribe to an announcement channel, where they will receive notifications of new announcements published by the platform.

Usage
Each project is a standalone console application designed to demonstrate the pattern it implements. To run a project, simply open it in your IDE and execute Program.cs. The console output will display how the pattern handles different requests, operations, and notifications.

Running Each Project
ChainOfResponsibilityApp:

Observe how requests are handled by different levels of support handlers in the chain.
Modify Program.cs to add or test more request types if desired.
CommandPatternApp:

Test how commands are executed and undone using the CommandInvoker.
Modify Program.cs to add more commands or adjust the invokerâ€™s behavior as needed.
ObserverPatternApp:

Add more observers or modify the announcements in Program.cs to test how observers receive notifications from the subject.
